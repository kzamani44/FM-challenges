## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt more about HTML structure. Apparently writing good & quick CSS will depend largely on how you structure your HTML. This was a great for me to know because it enabled me to write fewer lines of css for mobile screens.



### Continued development

I will focus more on how to use fewer lines of HTML to make my code cleaner to read. 


### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_hsla.php) - This helped me for learning about hsla(). i was used to rgba() which made me think the "a" in rgba() was similar to that in hsla()
